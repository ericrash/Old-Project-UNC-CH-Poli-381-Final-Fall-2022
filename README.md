This repository contains all of the material used in a previous final at UNC Chapel Hill. The objective of the project was to predict the results of the 2022 midterm electoral races.

If you want to see the full report, it is under "Final Paper (Revised) (1).pdf." If you want to look at the code used to generate this report look at "Final Project.R" which uses "cces18.csv", "final_project_urban.R"
uses "NHGIS.csv" "finaldata.Rdata" and "finaldata2.Rdata." File "Final_regression.R" contains "finaldata.Rdata", "finaldata2.Rdata" and "final_data_urb.Rdata" which is created in "final_project_urban.R"

That should be a reasonable explanation of what is needed to use/interpret the information in this repository. Thank you for looking at my work! (:
